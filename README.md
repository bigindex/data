      - 80-90: elite performance,
      - above 90: world class performance.

- 4 indices:
      1. own index (very simple, basic factors only) that serves as a base
      2. selected public and private player rating systems (tested, reliable, quality but we edited them to remove weaknesses found in research) and player ratings by selected newspapers / journalists. 
      3. fans' ratings - 20 teams, 20 knowledgeable fans (usually working in football industry and running fan accounts of their favourite teams).
      4. little factors (that we identified through research) that add the final touch to the index 


Of course, these indices do not carry the same weight.
